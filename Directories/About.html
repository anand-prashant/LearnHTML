        <h2>About LearnHTML</h2>
        <p>In this website I&#8217;ve published the whole lesson on <b>HTML</b> whose texts, references and every content has been taken from
        <i>the Handbook on HTML</i> by <a href="https://codewithharry.com">CodeWithHarry</a>. And the credit of the content goes to him only.
    I learnt the whole HTML from CodeWithHarry.</p>
        <h2>A small talk</h2>
        <p>I am Anand Prashant, a first semester Computer Science and Engineering student at Lovely Professional University, Punjab.</p><br>
        <p>
            HTML, as a part of my course taught me many things about web designing and publishing. As execution 
            of my knowledge on HTML — this website is the result of it!
        </p>
        <p>This website is more than just a project for me, it&#8217;s a journey. 
            When I started building LearnHTML with just HTML and CSS, 
            I thought it would be simple. But very soon, 
            I realized it was something deeper.</p> <br>

        <p>In those four days of creating this website, I learned things that no textbook or theory
            could have taught me. It wasn&#8217;t just about writing &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, 
            or &lt;div&gt; tags… it was about shaping an idea into something real. And when we talk about
            &#8220;idea&#8221;, you&#8217;re actually flooded with ideas when you start building something. And the
            challenging part is to pick that &#8220;one idea&#8221; which can be actually executed, not just in
            mind but in the browser too!</p>
            <p>If I may compare coding to something easily understood, it would be an artist making a painting. Every time I typed in VS Code, I felt like adding a new brushstroke to a canvas.</p> <br>

        <p>I can honestly say those four days were some of the most productive and meaningful 
            of my life. I didn&#8217;t just learn to code — I felt it. I felt the excitement, 
            the frustration, the small victories, and the joy of watching an idea turn into 
            a real, working website.</p> <br>
        <p>To see the code of this page, you may go to the <a href="https://github.com/anand-prashant/LearnHTML/">GitHub repository page</a> where all the codes are written for this website.</p>
                    
        <p>When your energy is high and your heart is in it, coding becomes something magical. 
            You don&#8217;t just see the code — you see the website in your mind, alive, even before it runs
            on your screen. And that, to me, is the true beauty of creating.</p>
